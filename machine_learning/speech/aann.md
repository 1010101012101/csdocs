# Auto Associative Neural Net

* create universal background model (UBM) from all speakers
* then change last layer for speaker-specific model
* why adapt the last layer ? bcos its a linear func
* if you adapt first layer - its a nonlinear func - which needs more data 

speech -> feature vector var length -> fixed vector
