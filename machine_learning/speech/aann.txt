older models based on GMM (gaussian mixture models)

============
Auto Associative Neural Net

create universal background model (UBM) from all speakers
then change last layer for speaker-specific model
why adapt the last layer - its a linear func
if you adapt first layer - its a nonlinear func - which needs more data 

speech -> feature vector var length -> fixed vector
