1. CAN BE MORE ROBUST TO EXTREME CLASS IMBALANCE.
2. CAN BE GOOD TO ENSEMBLE WITH A CLASSIFIER.
3. CAN YIELD BETTER EMBEDDINGS.

Siamese suited for cases where you have few examples per Class.

Triplet network

Three inputs
x, x+ are of same class
x- is of diff class

Used in google Facenet

"The motivation is that the loss from  [14]  encourages  all  faces  of  
one  identity  to  be  projected  onto  a  single  point  in  the  
embedding  space.   The triplet loss, however, tries to enforce a margin 
between each pair of faces from one person to all other faces.   
This allows the faces for one identity to live on a manifold, while
still enforcing the distance and thus discriminability to other
identities."
