We randomly partitioned our data into three subsets: training (80%), validation (10%) and test (10%). We used the validation set during development to choose model hyperparameters (Section 4.2), and we used the test set to evaluate final model performance (Section 5.1). This is the gold-standard way to evaluate model performance because the test set contains no data used to optimize the model in any way.
