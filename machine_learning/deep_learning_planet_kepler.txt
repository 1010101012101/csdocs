Identifying Exoplanets with Deep Learning -Shallue, Vanderburg

TCE : threshold crossing event

LPP metric : filter out light curves with "not transit like" shapes.

This paper: deep neural net for vetting Kepler TCE.

light curves are input
trained on human-classified TCE

feed views through separate convolutional columns (Ciresan 2012)

representation learning : learn features automatically frmom data.

Model performance metrics
1. precision/reliability : 
2. recall/completeness : 
3. accuracy
4. AUC (area under ROC curve)

Prediction heat map  : how does output change as you vary subset of input

TODO 
Ciresan 2012 : convolutional columns
