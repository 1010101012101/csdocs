# Skip thought vectors

* unsupervised learning 
* surrounding sentences are used to learn sentence vectors
* Used to create fixed length representation of sentence
* Three parts : Encoder feeds to Prev decoder and Next decoder
* End product is Encoder (decoder thrown away)
* Encoder is used to generate fixed length representations of sentences

Applications
1. Can be used to tell if two sentences are similar
2. Can be used to tell if sentence is positive/negative
