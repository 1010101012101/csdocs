Model Capacity is ability to fit a wide variety of functions

hypothesis space : set of functions that learning algo used to select as the solution

It is changed by changing number of input features, and parameters associated with those features.

Statistical learning theory provides various means of quantifying model capacity.  Among these, the most well-known is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, or VC dimension. The VC dimension measures the capacity of a binary classifier. The VC dimension is defined as being the largest possible value of m for which there exists a training set of m different x points that the classifier can label arbitrarily.
