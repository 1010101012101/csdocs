Three ways to produce word embeddings:

1. Count-based. 
	Define basis vocabulary. 
	Define word window.  
	Create vector based on presence of basis words occur in word window to left and right
	Normalize using TF-IDF

2. predictive
  Neural embedding E
  CBoW, Skip-gram

3. task-based
  Bag of words classifier
