Convolutional layer

-----
Pooling layer
aggregate regions that are spaced "s" neurons apart, where s = stride length. 
mean
max
make network translation-invariant

-----
Output layer
for classification problems, each neuron's value lies in [0, 1]

-------

Neural net
0. Linear : no hidden layers equiv to linear logistic regression.  assumes input data is linearly separable.
1. Fully connected  : ignore spatial structure
2. CNN : learn local feature
3. Capsule : 


---------

neural net is traind to minimize a cost function
1. for binary classification : cross-entropy error function
