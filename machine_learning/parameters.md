# batch size 

The batch size limits the number of samples to be shown to the network before a weight update can be performed

# number of iterations

Number of iterations * batch size = entire training dataset

# epoch 

one epoch is when entire training dataset is passed ONCE forward and backward through neural network

# loss function

# learning rate
