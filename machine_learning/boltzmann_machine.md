# Boltzmann machine


# Restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)

* Energy base model - where training is done to minimize energy function
* No intralayer connections between hidden units
* This results in more efficient training algo (Gibbs sampling + contrastive divergence).  No SGD

## Applications

### Recommender systems

Hidden nodes expose latent factors in data

# Conditional Boltzmann

# Deep Belief Network (Stacked RBM)

# Deep Boltzmann machine(Stacked RBM with connections between hidden units)
