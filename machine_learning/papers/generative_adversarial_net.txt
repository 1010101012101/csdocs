Minimax two-player game

Simultaneously train two models
1. Generative model G captures data distribution.  Must maximize probability of D making mistake
2. Discriminative model D estimates probability that sample came from training data rather than G 

The generative model can be thought of as analogous to a team of counterfeiters,
trying to produce fake currency and use it without detection, while the discriminative model is
analogous to the police, trying to detect the counterfeit currency.

In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, 
with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere

we alternate between k steps of optimizing D and one step of optimizing G.

The generator nets used a mixture of rectifier linear activations and sigmoid activations. 
the discriminator net used maxout activations. 
Dropout was applied in training the discriminator net.
