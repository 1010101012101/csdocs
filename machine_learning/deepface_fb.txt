Detect face
2D alignment : 6 fiducial points detected using Support Vector Regressor
3D alignment : 67 fiducial points detected using SVR

At each iteration, fiducial points are extracted by
a Support Vector Regressor (SVR) trained to predict point
configurations from an image descriptor. Our image de-
scriptor is based on LBP Histograms

Max-pooling layers make the
output of convolution networks more robust to local trans-
lations. When applied to aligned facial images, they make
the network more robust to small registration errors. How-
ever, several levels of pooling would cause the network to
lose information about the precise position of detailed facial
structure and micro-textures. Hence, we apply max-pooling
only to the first convolutional layer.

every location in the feature map learns
a different set of filters. Since different regions of an aligned
image have different local statistics, the spatial stationarity
assumption of convolution cannot hold. For example, ar-
eas between the eyes and the eyebrows exhibit very differ-
ent appearance and have much higher discrimination ability
compared to areas between the nose and the mouth. In other
words, we customize the architecture of the DNN by lever-
aging the fact that our input images are aligned.

Finally, the top two layers (F7 and F8) are fully con-
nected: each output unit is connected to all inputs. These
layers are able to capture correlations between features cap-
tured in distant parts of the face images, e.g., position and
shape of eyes and position and shape of mouth.

As a final stage we normalize the features to be between zero 
and one in order to reduce the sensitivity to illumination changes:

Notice that in order to prevent overfitting on
the face verification task, we enable training for only the
two topmost layers
