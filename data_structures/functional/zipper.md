# Zipper Tree (huet)

cursor deep into a structure which allows O(1) updates
focus is on a node

> The basic idea is simple: the tree is turned inside-out like a returned 
> glove, pointers from the root to the current position being reversed in 
> a path structure. The current location holds both the downward current 
> subtree and the upward path. All navigation and modification primitives 
> operate on the location structure. Going up and down in the structure 
> is analogous to closing and opening a zipper in a piece of clothing, 
> whence the name

# Zipper list 

```
list = ((first n-1 elements reversed) nth element (remaining elements))
```

first half is reversed so you can quickly get previous element which is this case is head
