immutable and mutable objects

All number types, strings, tuples are immutable

mutable obj can be changed if variable assigned to another var
e.g.

{
    val p = Point(2, 5)
    val q = p
    q.x = p (changes p also!)
}

Arrays are mutable
{
    val A = Array(1, 2, 3)
    val B = A
    A(2) = 99
    B
}
