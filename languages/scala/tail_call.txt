// Tail recursive solution.  Theoretically more efficient; with tail-call
  // elimination in the compiler, this would run in constant space.
  // Unfortunately, the JVM doesn't do tail-call elimination in the general
  // case.  Scala *will* do it if the method is either final or is a local
  // function.  In this case, `lengthR` is a local function, so it should
  // be properly optimized.
