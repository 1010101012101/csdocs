4) lambda func
   (x: Int) => code

11) Nested funcs allowed. they access param and local var of enclosing func

12) Some things auto-imported from redef library

13) Interpolated string (2.10)

you say f(s"abc def")

Pattern matching binds to variables inside an object
this works because Scala looks for extractors (i.e. "unapply" method)
extractor is opposite of constructor
Scala has some pre-defined extractor

If the result of calling unapply is Some[T], this means that the pattern matches, and the extracted value is bound to the variable declared in the pattern. If it is None, this means that the pattern doesnâ€™t match and the next case statement is tested.
