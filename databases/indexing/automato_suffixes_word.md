One of the most surprising facts related to pattern matching and discovered by Ehrenfeucht et al. [2] is that the size of the minimal automaton accepting the suffixes of a word is linear. The surprise is due to the maximal number of subwords that may occur in a word: it is quadratic according to the length of the word. This is obviously true if the alphabet is unbounded, but still holds if the alphabet contains at least two letters. In addition to the previous result, Ehrenfeucht et al. proved that the automaton can be built in linear time, which is indeed a consequence of the previous fact but does not come readily from it
