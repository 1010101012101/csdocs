Flash   Writes    are   slower    than  Reads.    
  
Flash   Writes    must  be    sequential    within    a Flash “block”   (typically    128-­‐256 Kbyte).   
  
Flash   blocks    are   larger    than  user  data  blocks,   and   hence a mapping   system    is    required. 
  
Flash   blocks    must  be    erased    before    they  are   written.  
  
Flash   Erases    take  a long  time  (milliseconds)    and   can   block Reads or    Writes    to    the   same  chip.   
  
Flash   blocks    can   only  be    erased    a number    of    times before    they  physically    wear  out   and   cannot  be    used  again.    
  
Flash   errors    increase  with  Reads.    

Flash   loses data  over  time, even  when  not   being used. 
  
Flash   can   fail  at    the   block,    page, or    die   level;    all   of    which must  be    accounted for.
