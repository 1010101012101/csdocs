trade off memory and IO capacity

if a record is accessed 

price of RAM memory to hold a record of 1 KB  + 
the (fractional) price of a disk drive required to access such
a record every 400 seconds, which they rounded to 5 minutes.


Gray and Putzolo introduced the formula 

BreakEvenIntervalinSeconds
= (PagesPerMBofRAM / AccessesPerSecondPerDisk) Ã— (PricePerDiskDrive / PricePerMBofRAM)
