Kryder rate : anual percent drop in $/GB

exponential increase in disk capacity at constant form factor
=> exp decrease in $/GB

disks are retained for only 5 years because Kryder rate means 
longer service life is economically unjustifiable.

Few organizations have the ability to pay more upfront to 
invest in long-term storage

Kryder's Law curve is actually the superposition of a series of 
S-curves, one for each successive technology generation

Since margins are constrained and so, these days, are volumes, to 
generate a return on the investment in each transition requires that 
the technology be kept in the market longer. The longer interval 
between transitions translates to a lower Kryder rate.

Seagate could easily make disks with archival life, but they did a study of the market for them, and discovered that no-one would pay the relatively small additional cost.  The drives currently marketed for "archival" use have a shorter warranty and a shorter MTBF than the enterprise drives, so they're not expected to have long service lives.  

The fundamental problem is that long-lived media only make sense at very low Kryder rates. Even if the rate is only 10%/yr, after 10 years you could store the same data in 1/3 the space. Since space in the data center racks or even at Iron Mountain isn't free, this is a powerful incentive to move old media out. If you believe that Kryder rates will get back to 30%/yr, after a decade you could store 30 times as much data in the same space.

Disks in
1. laptop
2. mobile
3. server
4. data center

Data center disks are always part of large collection 
- optimize for collection rather than individual server

Vertical vs horizontal scaling pros and cons
1) power cost
2) software license cost
3) reliability 
4) capacity planning

Scaling out works only if you use open-source software
