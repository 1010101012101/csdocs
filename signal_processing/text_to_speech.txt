Requirement
1. different language 
2. adapt to different speakers and different accents
3. emit emotions and sentiment

Steps
1. Frontend extracting linguistic features
2. Duration model
3. Acoustic Feature prediction model
4. Vocoder

If each component is trained independently, errors can get magnified

Alternative Architectures
1. concatenative : generate sentence from database of short fragments.
2. parametric : encode all data in model parameters.
