Background subtraction : distinguish foreground from background

------------

Challenges - how to maintain background in presence of 
1. Noise
3. Dynamic background (camera change, change in shape e.g. waves)
4. Camouflage
5. Bootstrapping : if initial data free from foreground not available, background needs bootstrap
6. Illumination change (sudden, gradual, shadows)

Piccardi : background subtraction techniques review

1. Adjacent Frame difference : Frame(i) - Frame(i-1) > Threshold
2. background = average of last n frames
3. background = running average
( need methods which handle multimodal distributions, adaptive threshold)
4. Running Gaussian average
5. Mixture of K Gaussians models both background and foreground
6. Kernel density estimator
7. Mean shift based estimation
8. Sequential kernel density approximation
9. Eigenbackground

Spatial correlation

Wallflower

Wallflower, a three-component system for background maintenance: 

1. pixel-level component performs Wiener filtering to make probabilistic predictions of the expected background; Any pixel that deviates significantly from predicted value is classified as foreground.

2. region-level component fills in homogeneous regions of foreground objects.

3. frame-level component detects sudden, global changes in the image and swaps in better approximations of the background.
