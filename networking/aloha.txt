Slotted Aloha (Time division multiplexing)

Tree Splitting algo for decentralized collision resolution
it does not require shared database or central coordinator 
but requires channel feedback (0, 1, c) on transmission

Splitting algo has 2 modes : normal and collision
when collision occurs in slot k, 
all nodes not involved in collision go into waiting mode
the rest are split into two subsets

Rules for splitting nodes decide when to transmit after collision
1. use random choice
2. use arrival time of collided packe
3. use node identifier
