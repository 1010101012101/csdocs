Business Time series modeling and forecasting
Tuning parameters are made intuitive to analyst

2. ets : exp smoothing
3. snaive : random walk with seasonality
4. tbats : De Livera

------------

y(t) = g(t) + s(t) + h(t) + e_t

g(t) = trend non-periodic changes
s(t) = weekly and annual seasonality
h(t) = holidays
e_t = error term normally distributed

Similar to GAM (generalized additive model)

"Multiplicative seasonality, where the seasonal effect is a factor that multiplies g(t), can be accomplished through a log transform"

GAM fitting using L-BFGS or backfitting

------------
Two models for Trend g(t)

1. Saturating growth model : 

Nonlinear growth of population which saturates at carrying capacity.
Modeled using Logistic growth

Carrying capacity : saturation point
Changepoint is growth-altering event.  Use known dates when product changed
Rate at time t = sum of all growth altering events in past.
Offset parameter :

C(t) = time varying capacity of system (max possible)
Rate at time t = k + a(t)_transpose.Delta

Delta = vector of S where Delta[t] = change in rate at time t

g(t) = C(t) / (see paper for denominator)

2. Linear trend with changepoints

------------
Seasonality s(t)

Use fourier series for multi-period seasonality
Beta = Normal Distribution to impose smoothing prior

------------

Holiday h(t)

h(t) = Z(t).K

K = smoothing prior
Z(t) = vector of holiday
additional parameter to define window around holiday
