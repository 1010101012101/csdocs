P-value not enuf
New statistics use effect sizes and confidence interval

Meehl paradox : rejecting null gets easier as precision increases
To solve Meehl paradox, use ROPE (region of practical equiv) : equivalence testing using CI [ Serlin and Lapsley]
Confidence intervals are as fickle as p-values - sensitive to sampling and testing - because they are dependent on p-values.
