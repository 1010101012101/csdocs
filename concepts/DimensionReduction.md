# Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma 

it works for smaller points in hi-dim space : 

for n points in R^d, exists linear map that preserves isometry 
    f : R^d _. R^k

* where k is logarithmic in n and independent of d
* where k > 4.(1/eps_factor).log(n)

Map can be found in randomized poly time

Can be adapted to Online algo (muthukrishnan)
