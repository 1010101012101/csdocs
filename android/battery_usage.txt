Battery instrumentation at facebook

Tools
1. trepn
2. android studio profiler

network usage
cpu power

these tools require developer to plugin

user reported battery level is noisy, coarse and inaccurate
report of 100 percent can be less, 1 percent can be more
level not monotonically decreasing in reality

measure individual component usage - 
cpu net camera location gpu screen

cpu consumption : power depends cube of cpu freq
smaller vs larger cores
android - look at /proc and sysfs
/sys/devices...cpufreq/stats
HealthStats 

network radio : used for data transfer
has 3 levels - idle, waiting, high 
time at high level decided by 2g, 3g, provider
android - look at TrafficStats, /proc/net/xt_qtaguid/stats, HealthStats

camera power consumption
custom call site instrumentation
HealthStats

location power consumption
location decided by gps, wifi, cached info
measured based on which method was used
gps instrumentation
wifi scan

gpu utilization 
could not find method to find battery consumption

screen 
dont measure

app background vs foreground power usage ?
background usage must be near zero
upload data between foreground and background transitions

how to model battery drain
xml file in android displays power profile
shows cost of each component

graph of power drain per user per foreground hour
sum of cpu, net, camera, location

dont wakeup app to measure battery

to find battery regression bugs
need attribute instrumentation for each component
measure thread level cpu instead of process
complicated by use of thread pool

created tool called cpu spin detector 
take stack trace (callsite)

do same for net, camera, location

camera leak detector
- if camera opened in background
- if camera not closed while going to background

wakelocks - cause battery drain
job scheduler
alarms - 

things that cause battery drain
* dont do anything in background
* be careful of wakelocks and background tasks 
* dont subscribe to events u dont care about 
* use jobscheduler, inexact alarms for background scheduling
* beware of cpu spins
* animation leak 
* dont leave camera open
* only use location accuracy that u need (gps, wifi, cached)
