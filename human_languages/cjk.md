## Japanese

Japanese text is combo of Han characters, Katakana and Hiragana.  

Katakana is used to write non-Japanese (non-Chinese) words.  

Morphological analysis (stemming) is needed for inflectional languages like Japanese.

Japanese has 2 char for "postal stamp", but these two char individually mean "to cut" and "hand".
